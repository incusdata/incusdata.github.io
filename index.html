<img src="img/programmers-rule.png" align="right" width="400">
<p>Robert C. Martin (aka Uncle Bob) wrote this about <a href="https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2014/11/15/WeRuleTheWorld.html">the obligation of the programmer</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
“We programmers. We rule the world. We write the rules that make our society work.
<br/>
Think about it; and think about it carefully. Nothing happens in our society without software. Nothing.<br/>
...With great power comes great responsibility. We, as programmers, should recognize that responsibility and determine to be conscientious servants of our society. We should set the limits and standards of our behavior.”</blockquote>

<p>We believe that. And that's why the Incus Data slogan is <strong>CODING MATTERS</strong>.</p>

<h2>Coding as art and function</h2>

<img src="img/anvil.png" align="left" style="width:250px; padding-right: 20px">
<p>The word <em>incus</em> is a Latin word which means anvil. The craftsmen of years gone by used their anvils to create practical tools and beautiful objects.</p>
<p>Programmers are the smiths of the modern age. Code must be functional, but great code also has beauty and elegance.</p>
<p>For us, the anvil is a symbol of both the art and function of programming.</p>

<h2>Never stop learning</h2>
<p>Good programmers never stop learning. There are always new technologies, updated features, different ways to do things.</p>
<p>This is why the ACM/IEEE Software Engineering Code of Ethics and Professional Practice includes life-long learning as its 8th principle. You will find this echoed in other ethical standards for programmers.</p>

<p>Incus Data has been training programmers for more than 30 years. We're a small, focused team, and we only teach what we know.</p>
<p>You can find a <a href="https://incusdata.com/courses">list of courses</a> that we offer on our <a href="https://incusdata.com">website</a>.</p>

<h2>Our GitHub repositories</h2> 

<p>Many of the programmers on our courses use Github for their own projects. So it makes sense for us to make course material and coding examples available on GitHub as well.</p>
<p>This is a new approach for us, but it aligns with our commitment to virtual instructor-led training. It means you will be able to access the course material from anywhere and at any time. If you lose the original course material, examples or exercises, you can find it here easily.</p>

<p>We cover a lot of material during the average 5-day course. The GitHub structure makes it easy to navigate and find what you need. And, of course, GitHub's search functionality will also save you time and effort when you are looking for something specific.</p>

<p>Over time, we plan to create a repository for most of the courses we offer. As you can imagine, this will take a huge investment of time. It won't happen overnight, and it will require continual updating. So make sure to check back regularly.</p>


<h2>Content for everyone</h2>

<p>We are happy to share our work with everyone - not just the delegates who come on our courses. Why? Because people don't come on our courses for the content - they come for the instructor. To be able to ask questions and get answers and learn new ways of thinking.</p>

<p>We hope that you will find something useful here. If you do  — or even if you just appreciate the idea — please <strong>follow us on GitHub</strong>. 

<p>And if you have questions, comments or pick up an error, please submit a pull request. We appreciate your participation.</p>
